Perfect — thanks for sharing the outlines. I’ve reviewed them, and they give us a strong backbone for a book proposal aimed at **O’Reilly**.

Here’s a draft structure for your proposal, mapped directly from your course outlines:

---

# **Book Proposal: AI-Ready APIs**

*Proposed for O’Reilly Media*

---

## 1. Overview

APIs are entering a new phase. For decades, APIs were designed with **human developers** in mind—supported by documentation, portals, and intuition. But in today’s world of **AI agents, orchestration engines, and autonomous workflows**, APIs must adapt. Machines can’t browse documentation or guess intent. They need **clear goals, machine-readable context, predictable interactions, discovery signals, and adaptive feedback loops**.

This book, **AI-Ready APIs**, shows architects and developers how to make their APIs consumable not only by people, but also by machines. It provides a practical, systems-oriented framework built around **five key shifts** and introduces both **Machine-Centric Protocols (MCPs)** and **advanced modeling approaches (ALPS, TypeSpec, Smithy)** as tools for future-proof design.

---

## 2. Target Audience

* **Primary:** API developers, software architects, and engineering leads building APIs in enterprise and startup environments.
* **Secondary:** Product managers, platform strategists, and students in computer science / information systems.
* **Assumed Background:** Readers should know the basics of REST/HTTP APIs but need not be advanced specialists.

---

## 3. Market Need & Positioning

* **Why now?** The rise of LLMs, autonomous agents, and orchestration platforms makes machine-consumable APIs urgent. Organizations that fail to adapt risk being bypassed.
* **Gap in the market:** Existing API books focus on REST, GraphQL, or gRPC mechanics. Few address **machine-centered affordances**, **intent modeling**, or **discovery signals**.
* **Comparable Titles:**

  * *RESTful Web APIs* (O’Reilly, Fielding/Amundsen et al.) — focused on hypermedia for humans.
  * *Designing Web APIs* (O’Reilly, 2019) — pragmatic REST/GraphQL design.
  * No direct competitor currently addresses the **AI-readiness** dimension. This book fills that gap.

## 4. Proposed Table of Contents

Drawn from your lesson outlines:

1. **The New Challenge** – From human-centered to machine-centered APIs; why this shift is urgent.
2. **From Interfaces to Intentions** – Designing for intent rather than mechanics.
3. **Make Context Machine-Readable** – Embedding ownership, policies, and constraints.
4. **Standardize Interactions** – Conventions, predictability, and resilience.
5. **Enable Discovery Through Ecosystem Signals** – Registries, hypermedia, and metadata.
6. **Observe, Adapt, and Iterate** – Feedback loops, telemetry, and living systems.
7. **Machine-Centric Protocols (MCPs)** – Wrapping legacy APIs for agent readiness.
8. **Advanced Models and Future Directions** – ALPS, TypeSpec, Smithy, and affordance-first ecosystems.
9. **Summary and Next Steps** – Roadmap for teams, practical guidance, resources.

## 5. Sample Chapter Descriptions

* **Chapter 1: The New Challenge**
  Frames the transition from human-centric APIs to machine-centric affordances. Explains why traditional APIs fail agents and introduces the five shifts.

* **Chapter 2: From Interfaces to Intentions**
  Shows how to model APIs around *what* and *why* rather than *how*. Uses affordances and intent modeling tools.

* **Chapter 3: Make Context Machine-Readable**
  Explains the role of metadata, ownership, and capability statements in empowering autonomous decision-making.

* **Chapter 4: Standardize Interactions**
  Demonstrates how uniform error handling, retries, and pagination enable agent trust and composability.

* **Chapter 5: Enable Discovery Through Signals**
  Discusses registries, hypermedia, APIs.json, and ecosystem indexing for machine navigation.

* **Chapter 6: Observe, Adapt, and Iterate**
  Introduces APIs as living systems, showing how telemetry and feedback loops sustain long-term relevance.

* **Chapter 7: Machine-Centric Protocols (MCPs)**
  Provides practical guidance for wrapping legacy APIs into MCP manifests that expose intent, context, and schemas.

* **Chapter 8: Advanced Models and Future Directions**
  Explores affordance-first design via ALPS, TypeSpec, and Smithy. Frames the vision of adaptive, agentic ecosystems.

* **Chapter 9: Summary and Next Steps**
  Recaps the five shifts, MCP bridge, and advanced models; provides actionable next steps and resources.

## 6. Author Bio

Mike Amundsen is an internationally recognized author and speaker on web architecture and APIs. He has written several O’Reilly titles (*RESTful Web APIs*, *Design and Build Great APIs*, *RESTful Web Clients*) and is a frequent keynote speaker at API and software architecture conferences worldwide. Mike’s current work focuses on the intersection of hypermedia, systems thinking, and machine-ready API ecosystems.

---

## 7. Marketing & Platform

* **Talks and Workshops:** Regular keynote speaker at API conferences (e.g., API World, Nordic APIs, API Days).
* **Substack Newsletter:** *Signals from our Futures Past* (growing readership among API and AI practitioners).
* **Leanpub & Whitepapers:** Related works (e.g., *Preparing Your APIs for AI Agents*).
* **Community Presence:** Active on LinkedIn, GitHub, and Mastodon, with a network of practitioners and students.

O’Reilly can leverage this platform to reach **API professionals, enterprise architects, and AI developers** who are grappling with AI integration today.

---

## 8. Specs & Timeline

* **Length:** ~250–300 pages
* **Format:** Print + e-book, with diagrams, code snippets, and case studies
* **Delivery:** Manuscript in 6–8 months from contract

✅ This gives you a **publisher-ready proposal**.
We can polish language further for O’Reilly’s house style and add a **sample chapter excerpt** (likely from *The New Challenge* or *From Interfaces to Intentions*).

Would you like me to **draft the sample chapter excerpt** as part of this proposal (so you can submit a full package to O’Reilly)?
