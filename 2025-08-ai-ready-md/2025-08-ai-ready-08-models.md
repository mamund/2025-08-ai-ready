# Advanced Models and Future Directions

* Beyond MCPs: full affordance-driven design
* Rich modeling for **intent, context, and interaction**
* Path toward **adaptive, agent-ready ecosystems**

*Instructor note: frames Q1 (scope of advanced models)*

# Donella Meadows on Systems Thinking

> “We can’t impose our will on a system. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone.”
> — Donella Meadows (Thinking in Systems)


* Anchor for systems modeling and leverage points
* Her voice brings clarity about how small shifts in design can change the behavior of whole systems — exactly what ALPS affords.

# Why Move Beyond MCPs

* MCPs are **adapters**, not complete solutions
* Advanced models describe **system-level behavior**
* Long-term resilience comes from **affordance-first design**

*Instructor note: ties to Q2 (why MCPs are transitional)*

---

# Affordance Modeling with ALPS

* ALPS = **Application-Level Profile Semantics**
* Describes **states, transitions, and affordances**
* Lightweight, machine-readable, and intent-focused

*Instructor note: connects to Q3 (role of ALPS)*

---

# TypeSpec and Smithy

* TypeSpec: modeling language for APIs, schemas, services
* Smithy: extensible specification with strong typing
* Both support **affordance and capability modeling**

*Instructor note: supports Q4–Q5 (tools for advanced modeling)*

---

# Benefits of Advanced Models

* Improved **discoverability and adaptability**
* Clearer **contracts for machines and humans**
* Easier **evolution** of large ecosystems

*Instructor note: links to Q6–Q7 (benefits of advanced models)*

---

# Challenges to Adoption

* Steeper **learning curve** for teams
* Tooling still **maturing**
* Requires **ecosystem-wide buy-in**

*Instructor note: ties to Q8 (challenges of adoption)*

---

# Future of Adaptive Ecosystems

* APIs as **living environments**, not static products
* Continuous **evolution guided by usage telemetry**
* Inspired by **biological and ecological systems**

*Instructor note: connects to Q9 (future direction of ecosystems)*

---

# Vision of Agentic Systems

* Agents discovering and composing APIs on the fly
* Self-optimizing orchestration across domains
* Emergent behaviors enabled by **affordance modeling**

*Instructor note: ties to Q10–Q11 (agentic future scenarios)*

---

# The Road Ahead for Designers

* Start with MCPs to bridge the gap
* Adopt ALPS, TypeSpec, or Smithy for deeper modeling
* Build API ecosystems that can **learn and adapt**

*Instructor note: supports Q12–Q13 (guidance for practitioners)*

---

# Looking Ahead

* Unit 9 wraps up the journey
* Summarizes the **five shifts + MCPs + advanced models**
* Prepares participants with **next steps and resources**

*Instructor note: frames Q14–Q15 (transition to course closing)*
