# Enable Discovery Through Ecosystem Signals

* If agents can’t find your API, they can’t use it
* Machines can’t browse portals or scan changelogs
* Discovery depends on **ecosystem-wide signals**

*Instructor note: frames Q1 (why discovery is essential)*

# Ted Nelson on Intertwingularity

> “Everything is deeply intertwingled.”
> — Ted Nelson, Inventor of Hypertext

* Character anchor: discovery is about **connections, not silos**
* Machines need clear, consistent **signals to navigate ecosystems**

*Instructor note: ties to Q2 (who inspired this shift & their perspective)*

---

# Why Discovery Matters for Machines

* LLMs can’t fully parse long, narrative API docs
* Agents rely on **registries, links, metadata** to orient themselves
* Without signals, APIs remain **invisible to automation**

*Instructor note: connects to Q3 (why discovery is a challenge for machines)*

---

# Common Discovery Failures

* APIs published but **not registered** anywhere
* Documentation is **static and disconnected**
* Hypermedia links missing or inconsistent

*Instructor note: addresses Q4 (examples of discovery gaps)*

---

# Publishing API Indexes

* Register APIs in catalogs (Postman, SwaggerHub, internal registries)
* Publish machine-readable description documents (OpenAPI, APIs.json)
* Keep indexes **up to date and cross-linked**

*Instructor note: links to Q5 (practices for making APIs findable)*

---

# Using Metadata for Discovery

* Tag APIs with **semantic descriptors** (domain, purpose, capabilities)
* Provide **ownership, contact, and support metadata**
* Help agents classify and **choose relevant APIs**

*Instructor note: ties to Q6–Q7 (importance of metadata in discovery)*

---

# Hypermedia Signals

* Include links to **home, collection, item, update** consistently
* Use self-describing endpoints with navigation hints
* Support **progressive disclosure of capabilities**

*Instructor note: connects to Q8 (role of hypermedia links)*

---

# Standards and Tools for Discovery

* APIs.json for cross-API indexes
* RESTful hypermedia formats (HAL, Siren, Collection+JSON)
* Registry ecosystems for internal and external sharing

*Instructor note: links to Q9 (tools and standards for discovery)*

---

# Benefits of Enabling Discovery

* Increases API **visibility and reusability**
* Makes ecosystems **navigable by both humans and machines**
* Reduces onboarding time for new agents and developers

*Instructor note: ties to Q10–Q12 (benefits of discovery practices)*

---

# Looking Ahead

* Discovery makes APIs **findable and usable**
* Next: machines evolve in how they consume APIs
* Unit 6 explores how to **observe, adapt, and iterate**

*Instructor note: frames Q13–Q15 (forward-framing into next shift)*
