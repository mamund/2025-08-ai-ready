# The New Challenge

* From **human-centered** APIs to **machine-centered** affordances
* Why API design is entering a new phase
* Setting the stage for the five key shifts
  *Instructor note: frames Q1 (why APIs must adapt for machines)*

---

# A Changing Landscape

* APIs originally designed for **human developers**
* Documentation, portals, and GUIs supported human intuition
* Now: APIs must support **agents, bots, and orchestration engines**
  *Instructor note: ties to Q2 (shift from human to machine consumers)*

---

# The Problem with “Human First”

* Machines can’t **browse documentation** or guess intent
* HTTP verbs show **how**, not **why**
* Trial-and-error doesn’t scale at machine speed
  *Instructor note: connects to Q3 (why traditional APIs fall short)*

---

# What Machines Need

* **Clear intent** (goals, not just operations)
* **Machine-readable context** (ownership, constraints, purpose)
* **Predictability** in interactions
* **Signals for discovery** across ecosystems
  *Instructor note: supports Q4 & Q5 (machine needs vs. human needs)*

---

# Consequences of Not Adapting

* APIs become **opaque** to non-human consumers
* Agents struggle or fail to complete tasks
* Workarounds increase fragility and cost
* Risk of being bypassed in machine-driven workflows
  *Instructor note: links to Q6 (consequences of non-AI-ready design)*

---

# The Five Shifts (Preview)

* From **interfaces to intentions**
* Make **context machine-readable**
* Standardize **interactions** (not just endpoints)
* Enable **discovery** through ecosystem signals
* **Observe, adapt, iterate**
  *Instructor note: aligns with Q7 (identify the five shifts)*

---

# Human vs Machine Consumption

* **Humans**: rely on UI, text, exploration
* **Machines**: require **explicit, structured cues**
* Example: “Submit Application” (intent) vs “POST /applications” (mechanics)
  *Instructor note: addresses Q8 (contrast between human and machine consumption)*

---

# Why Now?

* Explosion of **LLMs and AI agents**
* Growth of **autonomous orchestration engines**
* Machine-to-machine integration is accelerating
* Advantage goes to those **AI-ready first**
  *Instructor note: links to Q9 (timeliness of the shift)*

---

# The Mindset Shift

* Think like a **systems architect**, not a UI designer
* Focus on **intentions and affordances**, not just endpoints
* Machines are **active collaborators**, not passive consumers
  *Instructor note: supports Q10 (design mindset change)*

---

# Framing the Challenge

* APIs must serve both **humans and machines**
* AI-readiness = **clarity, context, and discoverability**
* The journey begins with **rethinking assumptions**
* This unit frames the problem; next units explain the solutions
  *Instructor note: connects to Q11–15 (framing, relevance, future-proofing)*
