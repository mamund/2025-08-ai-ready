# Make Context Machine-Readable

* Context is the key to **autonomous decision-making**
* Machines need to know **who, why, constraints, and relationships**
* Without context, even well-structured APIs are opaque

*Instructor note: frames Q1 (definition of context for machines)*

# Douglas Engelbart on Improvement

> “The better we get at getting better, the faster we will get better.”
> — Douglas Engelbart, HCI Pioneer

* Character anchor: Engelbart focused on **augmenting human and system intelligence**
* Sets the stage for APIs that embed **rich, machine-readable context**

*Instructor note: ties to Q2 (who inspired this shift & their quote)*

---

# Why Metadata Matters

* Machines can’t rely on human interpretation
* Metadata provides **purpose, ownership, and rules**
* More metadata = more autonomy in machine reasoning

*Instructor note: connects to Q3 (importance of metadata)*

---

# Examples of Missing Context

* API returns data but not **ownership info**
* Resource provided without **versioning details**
* Endpoint exists without **domain or relevance cues**

*Instructor note: addresses Q4 (consequences of missing context)*

---

# Embedding Metadata in APIs

* Add endpoints for **ownership, capabilities, and policies**
* Use **machine-readable formats** (JSON, YAML, RDF, etc.)
* Include **versioning, terms of use, and constraints** directly in responses

*Instructor note: links to Q5–Q6 (practices for adding context)*

---

# Capability Statements

* Summarize **what an API can do**
* Include **methods, fields, formats, actions**
* Machines use these as “instructions” for safe interaction

*Instructor note: supports Q7 (value of capability statements)*

---

# Domain Affiliations

* Declare which **domain** an API belongs to (finance, retail, health, etc.)
* Helps machines **reason about relevance**
* Supports smarter **discovery and composition**

*Instructor note: ties to Q8 (importance of domain tagging)*

---

# Standards for Context Sharing

* APIs.json for declaring API ownership and capabilities
* JSON Schema or ALPS for describing affordances
* Consistency ensures agents can interpret across APIs

*Instructor note: links to Q9 (tools and standards for context)*

---

# Benefits of Machine-Readable Context

* Fewer errors and dead-ends in machine workflows
* Better **automation and orchestration**
* Improves both **machine and human developer experience**

*Instructor note: connects to Q10–Q12 (benefits of context-aware design)*

---

# Looking Ahead

* Context is a **building block** for autonomy
* Next: consistency matters as much as clarity
* Unit 4 explores how to **standardize interactions**

*Instructor note: frames Q13–Q15 (forward-framing into next shift)*
