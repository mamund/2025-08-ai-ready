# Observe, Adapt, and Iterate

* Machine usage is **not static** — it evolves
* APIs must change in response to **real-world usage patterns**
* Feedback loops are critical for **long-term success**

*Instructor note: frames Q1 (definition of the shift)*

# Christopher Alexander on Patterns

> “Each pattern is a solution to a problem in a context.”
> — Christopher Alexander, Architect & Author of *A Pattern Language*

* Character anchor: emphasizes **contextual adaptation**
* APIs should evolve like **living systems**

*Instructor note: ties to Q2 (who inspired this shift & their perspective)*

---

# Why Iteration Matters

* Agents adapt based on **local context** (greedy algorithms)
* What works today may fail tomorrow as contexts shift
* APIs that don’t evolve risk **irrelevance or failure**

*Instructor note: connects to Q3 (importance of adaptability)*

---

# Signs of Machine Friction

* Agents **failing or giving up** before task completion
* Patterns of **repeated errors** or retries
* Unexpected **fallback usage**

*Instructor note: addresses Q4 (how to detect machine struggles)*

---

# Role of Telemetry

* Monitor usage by **agents**, not just humans
* Track **success, failure, retries, drop-offs**
* Observability provides the raw data for **adaptation**

*Instructor note: links to Q5 (importance of telemetry)*

---

# Learning from Errors

* Repeated errors = signals for improvement
* Failures reveal where agents misunderstand or lack cues
* Each failure is **feedback, not noise**

*Instructor note: ties to Q6–Q7 (using failures constructively)*

---

# Treat APIs as Living Systems

* APIs are not static “products” — they **co-evolve with use**
* Adaptation ensures long-term **resilience and relevance**
* Like ecosystems, APIs must **grow and adjust**

*Instructor note: supports Q8 (APIs as living/adaptive systems)*

---

# Practices for Iteration

* Release updates in **small, observable increments**
* Use **feedback loops** to validate changes
* Balance **stability** with **evolution**

*Instructor note: connects to Q9–Q10 (practical iteration methods)*

---

# Benefits of Continuous Adaptation

* Stronger alignment with **real usage needs**
* More resilient to **changing contexts and agents**
* Builds trust and **long-term API adoption**

*Instructor note: ties to Q11–Q12 (benefits of adaptation)*

---

# Looking Ahead

* Iteration closes the loop on the five shifts
* Next: explore **Machine-Centric Protocols (MCPs)** as adapters
* Unit 7 introduces MCPs and their role in intent + context

*Instructor note: frames Q13–Q15 (forward-framing into next shift)*
