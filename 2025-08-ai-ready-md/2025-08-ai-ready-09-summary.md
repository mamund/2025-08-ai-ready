# Summary and Next Steps

* Review of the **five shifts** and MCP bridge
* Highlight **advanced models** for the future
* Emphasize the journey from **interfaces → intelligence**

*Instructor note: frames Q1 (purpose of the closing unit)*

---

# Recap: The Five Shifts

* From **interfaces to intentions**
* Make **context machine-readable**
* Standardize **interactions**
* Enable **discovery** through signals
* **Observe, adapt, and iterate**

*Instructor note: ties to Q2–Q3 (recall the five shifts)*

---

# Adding MCPs to the Toolbox

* MCPs bridge **legacy APIs** and **agent readiness**
* Provide structure for intent + context
* Serve as a **practical stepping stone**

*Instructor note: connects to Q4 (role of MCPs in the journey)*

---

# Advanced Models for the Future

* ALPS: semantic, lightweight affordance modeling
* TypeSpec & Smithy: extensible frameworks for complex systems
* Long-term **ecosystem adaptability**

*Instructor note: links to Q5 (future directions with advanced models)*

---

# Why This Matters Now

* Explosion of AI agents and orchestration engines
* APIs must adapt to remain **relevant and usable**
* Early adopters gain **strategic advantage**

*Instructor note: ties to Q6 (urgency of action)*

---

# What Success Looks Like

* APIs discoverable and context-rich
* Machines navigate APIs with **minimal trial-and-error**
* Ecosystems grow through **adaptation and signals**

*Instructor note: connects to Q7 (definition of success)*

---

# Your Next Steps

* Evaluate your current APIs for AI-readiness
* Add **metadata and discovery signals**
* Pilot an MCP wrapper for a legacy API
* Explore **affordance modeling tools**

*Instructor note: ties to Q8–Q9 (practical next steps)*

---

# Resources for Going Deeper

* Whitepaper: *Preparing Your APIs for AI Agents*
* Book: *RESTful Web API Patterns & Practices Cookbook*
* Specs & Tools: ALPS, APIs.json, TypeSpec, Smithy

*Instructor note: links to Q10 (resources for continued learning)*

---

# Q\&A Discussion

* Open space for participant questions
* Encourage sharing of **practical challenges**
* Explore real-world scenarios for applying the five shifts

*Instructor note: supports Q11–Q12 (interactive closing)*

---

# Final Thoughts

* Designing APIs for **humans and machines** is the new frontier
* Think like a **systems architect**, not just an endpoint designer
* The work is ongoing: **observe, adapt, and iterate**

*Instructor note: frames Q13–Q15 (closing inspiration)*
